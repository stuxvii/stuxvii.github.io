            hello? herro! my name is acidbox; sorry that the domain name is "stuxvii.com"
            <br>
            as that might be my old username.
            <br>
            the issue is that i simply lack the caring (and money for the matter)
            <br>
            to get a new domain for my new alias.
            <br>
            i am an amateur coder, specializing in PureBasic.
            <br>
            currently i've only written some private projects,
            <br>
            and my only public project is the minecraft launcher you may find at the main website.
            <br>
            to finish off, i am from argentinian, but speak english and spanish
