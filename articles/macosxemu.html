            <h1>Le' Mac OSX 10.0-10.3 emulated on your PC via QEMU</h1>
            Requirements:
            <div class="list">around 20 gbs of space (virtual disk drive + install iso)</div>
            <div class="list">QEMU (Emulator)</div>
            <div class="list"><a href="https://winworldpc.com/product/mac-os-x/100">A disk setup image of Mac OSX</a></div>
            <div class="list">Warning: If you're installing Mac OS 10.3 you will also need to download Disk 2. More info will be covered in the guide.</div>
            The ISO image will come inside a 7z fichier, be prepared to extract it<br><br>
            If you've already installed QEMU, ignore the QEMU installation steps and follow the instructions below on the bottom.
            <br>
            If not, follow these instructions to get QEMU on your machine:
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Windows</h3>
            Download and install <a href="https://www.msys2.org/">MSYS2.</a>
            <br>
            When installed, look for "MSYS2 UCRT64" in your start menu and open it.
            <br>
            After opening UCRT64, you will see a window resembling a CMD on your screen, this is were you will get QEMU. To do so, type and send the following command:
            <div class="code">pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-qemu</div>
            <h3>Linux</h3>
            This will depend on your distribution, and package manager.
            <br>
            I will list a couple of ways to get QEMU on popular distributions.
            <br>
            <br>
            Ubuntu/Debian
            <div class="code">apt install qemu-system</div>
            Arch Linux
            <div class="code">pacman -S qemu</div>
            Fedora
            <div class="code">dnf install @virtualization</div>
            Gentoo
            <div class="code">emerge --ask app-emulation/qemu</div>
            RHEL/CentOS
            <div class="code">yum install qemu-kvm</div>
            SUSE
            <div class="code">zypper install qemu</div>
            If your distro isn't listed, or the commands here aren't compatible for you, then Google (or your distros' wiki) will be of help to you to locate the package you must install and the way you must install it.
            <br>
            <br>
            Once successful, you may now prepare the VM.
            <br>
            <br>
            I would recommend you to make and enter a directory for all this, yk keep stuff tidy.
            <div class="code">mkdir macosvm</div>
            <div class="code">cd macosvm</div>
            In the terminal (or UCRT64 on Windows), create yourself a neat little qcow2 image for you to install that OSX.
            <div class="code">qemu-img create -f qcow2 mac.qcow2 10G</div>
            Tip: you may change "10G" to any other size, such as 20G or 50G.
            <br>
            <br>
            After that, identify the directory you're currently in. You will copy the ISO you have downloaded from WinWorldPC to the directory your VDD is in.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Windows</h3>
            <div class="list">Your MSYS2 folder (the folder where we just created a directory and a disk image in) will be found at C:\msys64\home\yourusername\</div>
            <h3>Linux</h3>
            <div class="list">Chances are, you can just do <div class="code">cp "~/Downloads/Apple Mac OS X 10.X.X - Disk 69.iso" ~/macosvm</div> and everything will be a-ok. if not, just copy it manually with your file browser or terminal</div>
            <br>
            OMG just hold on tight we're so close to finally starting this mac os stuff i've been teasing
            <br>
            so i recommend you rename the iso you've copied to something more easy to call, like idfk <div class="code">mac.iso</div> maybe?
            <br>
            Alright so if you're in the terminal, and you're in the directory where both your qcow2 file and iso file are located, then enter this command to rename the iso to something more simple.
            <div class="code">mv "Apple Mac OS X something something.iso" "mac.iso"</div>
            Now if you do
            <div class="code">ls</div>
            And this shows up
            <div class="code">mac.iso  mac.qcow2</div>
            You should now be good to run the virtual machine.
            <br>
            This is the moment you've been waiting for, booting up the ISO and installing Mac OS.
            <br>
            Run the following command.
            <div class="code">qemu-system-ppc -L pc-bios -boot d -M mac99 -m 2048 -hda mac.qcow2 -cdrom mac.iso</div>
            OMG OMG OMG!!! IT WAS ALL WORTH IT!!! YOU HAVE BOOTED INTO THE MAC OS INSTALLER!!!
            <br>
            Now, before actually proceeding, you will need to format the drive you've previously created, to do that, open Disk Utility and follow these next steps. (omg nextstep reference)
            <br>
            <br>
            Click on "Installer", and while holding the left click down, hover over "Open Disk Utility", and then let go of the left click.
            <br>
            <img src="mactut1step.png" style="width: 500px;">
            <br>
            Select your virtual hard drive.
            <br>
            <img src="mactut2step.png" style="width: 500px;">
            <br>
            Go to erase, optionally specify a name, and then click on erase to, appropriately, erase the drive.
            <br>
            <img src="mactut3step.png" style="width: 500px;">
            <br>
            And ta-da! a partition under the QEMU HARDDISK drive should appear with the name you've specified.
            <br>
            <img src="mactut4step.png" style="width: 500px;">
            <br>
            You can now quit Disk Utility to proceed with the installation by pressing the "Super/Meta/Windows + Q" keys, as it is to quit any application in Mac OS.
            <br>
            You should be able to proceed with the installation without any problems, although there is one present which is somewhat common.
            <br>
            <img src="mactut5step.png" style="width: 500px;">
            <br>
            Now, don't worry, you haven't done anything wrong, this is just a quirk with how Mac OS handles drives. This should be fixed via restarting the virtual machine, tl;dr, have you tried powering it off and on again?
            <br>
            But seriously, that is the fix, just close and reopen the VM.
            <br>
            After all that, the set-up should be smooth sailing.
            <br>
            Once the installer finishes installing, CLOSE the virtual machine, and then run 
            <div class="code">qemu-system-ppc -L pc-bios -boot c -M mac99 -m 2048 -hda mac.qcow2</div>
            to finish the setup.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Note for Mac OS 10.3</h3>
            Remember to get Disk 2, and to copy it in the macosvm folder you've created previously.
            <br>
            Rename it to something more usable.
            <div class="code">mv "Apple Mac OS X 10.3 - Disk 2" mac2.iso</div>
            Now let's boot the HARD DRIVE, and have the Disk 2 as our CD ROM, as to complete the install without any problems.
            <div class="code">qemu-system-ppc -L pc-bios -boot c -M mac99 -m 2048 -hda mac.qcow2 -cdrom mac2.iso</div>
            Changed: "-boot d" to "-boot c" (as to boot off the hdd); "-cdrom mac.iso" to "-cdrom mac2.iso" (as to have info on the Disk 2 available to the VM)
            <br>
            <h3>Extra</h3>
            Networking + better mouse control + debug, have fun!:
            <div class="code">qemu-system-ppc -L pc-bios -boot c -M mac99 -m 2048 -hda mac.qcow2 -display sdl -netdev user,id=network01 -device sungem,netdev=network01 -prom-env boot-args=-v</div>
        </div>
