hi, I just finished remaking this website because the old one was bad
<br>

I've currently been thinking about maybe doing a youtube or smth. <br>who’s providing spanish tech content like Michael MJD, Eric Parker, or Ardens? no one.<br> that is a huge market gap right there waiting to be covered!!! there simply isn't many videos about tech and such.<br> the space is filled to the brim with pirates and clickbaiters
<br>

there is one particularly egregious channel when it comes to those pirate clickbaiter channels. optijuegos
<br>

optijuegos that the 407 games in his site are fully optimized. first of all what does "optimized" mean in this case? <br>packaging community mods without permission? including config files? modifying procedures inside of the assembly?
<br>

optijuegos have been active since 2023. since what date? it is unknown, but looking in the wayback archive, <br>the earliest records of his site date to October 29, 2023.
<br>

Today is the 3rd of February of 2026, that would mean that optijuegos have been doing this for 828 days. <br>828 days divided by 407 games would amount to releasing an optimized game every 2 days, consistently.
<br>

This number is of course probably not accurate, and not that hard to pull off. Since optijuegos doesn't do anything much, <br>as he doesn't have access to any of the game's code, and profiling+reverse engineering even a single game would take weeks, <br>
he always either does 3 of these things to achieve that 407 game figure, from most common to least:

<br>
* not even optimize anything<br>
* bundle in optimization mods<br>
* downscale resources or straight out remove them<br>
<br>

The only game I saw any effort at all being done was his "opticraft" version of minecraft. <br>it had some significant style changes, and ran on windows 7 which was interesting, <br>before I realized it was just repackaged minecraft education edition.

This game version only gave me an improvement of 20 fps on my ATI HD 5670 against my minecraft bedrock copy,<br> which wouldn't be hard to believe is a rounding or measuring error of mine. <br>It would probably be much more noticeable on a slower computer, which in that case it would be worth using.

Currently, I cannot test on a worse computer than mine, to see if it actually IS worth it,<br> so I'm limited by this data I can gather.
