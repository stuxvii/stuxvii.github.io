            <h2>this website was basically made out of spite due to <a href="https://optijuegos.net">the existence of optijuegos</a> (you may notice some slight similarities between his' and my websites since i took some inspiration).

            <h1>why this one guy in specific???</h1>
            <h2>
            main reason i dont rlly like this guy is because he in general doesn't have good etic, for example he will upload unmodified games under the "optimized" label (what i am mentioning happens in around 70% of the games he shares), he would grab projects that are FOSS (like emulators utils for maintenance etc) and upload them himself to mediafire, instead of linking to the original website (which idk but seems a little sketchy) <br> when he DOES make repacks with "optimizations", he'll take credit for the mods he yoinked off nexus mods/gamebanana/etc, and literally no one has said anything about this kind of behaviors, and last but not least HE HAS ADS IN HIS WEBSITE. ik you gotta make a profit but MOTHERFUCKER??????????

            he also condones the use of custom windows ISOs, and old versions of windows, which if you know even the slightest of cybersecurity you'll know it's a NIGHTMARE because the first essentially work like a black box, with you not knowing what is going on under the hood (although yeahh windows does work that way altogether), with the second obviously not having security updates, which is why I MYSELF condone the use of <span onclick="alert('I just like to interject for a moment. What youre refering to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as Ive recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machines resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called Linux distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux!');">linux</span>, free as in freedom, mostly lightweight and open source family of operative systems, since you can know EVERYTHING that's happening in your system at real time
