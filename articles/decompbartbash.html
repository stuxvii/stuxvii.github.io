        <h3>Guide</h3>
        Download PCK Bruteforcer & gdsdecomp
        <br>
        Download the <a href="https://oxbowlakes.net/fewfe/neighbor.pck">.pck</a> and <a
            href="https://oxbowlakes.net/fewfe/neighbor.wasm">.wasm</a> files
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>* Compile PCK Bruteforcer</h4>
        PCK Bruteforcer doesn't have any available pre-built binaries, so you will have to compile this yourself to get
        this up and running.
        <br>
        Open Visual Studio
        <br>
        Click "Clone a repository"
        <br>
        Enter "https://github.com/DmitriySalnikov/GodotPCKExplorer.git" in the repository location section and hit
        "Clone"
        <br>
        When it finishes cloning, double click "GodotPCKExplorer.sln", open the Bruteforcer directory, double click the
        PCKBruteforcer.UI file, and finally, hit the CTRL+F5 keys to build and run.
        <br>
        Bruteforce the encryption key with PCK Bruteforcer, place the .wasm in the .exe field (yes, because .wasm are
        basically .exe files for web browsers) the .pck in the .pck field and hit "try to get the key"; After a while
        it'll give you the key for that build.
        <br>
        <br>
        Good job! Now open gdsdecomp, click the RE Tools button, set the key to the one PCK Bruteforcer gave you, and
        export the .pck into a neatly organized folder.
        <br>
        Now not all assets will be converted from Godot's format into standard formats, so that's where you will have to
        also convert every one of them into their corresponding original formats. DONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

        <h3>Backstory</h3>
        Recently i've seen a dumb little game pop-up in my TikTok FYP, and you probably have too.
        <br>
        It is called <a href="https://bartbash.com/">bartbash</a>, it's about clicking the bart, throwing the bart, and
        profit™️
        <br>
        And as one does, i was curious about how it worked, extracting its assets and such.
        <br>
        As it was a godot web game, i decided to try to the devtools panel from my browser, to find any leads for
        helping me begin to rip the assets,
        <br>
        <br>
        To my surprise, this website had gone to many extents to hide its relics from me, as blocking every hotkey to
        invoke the devtools panel, and making the whole page freeze when it was manually opened.
        <br>
        None of this stopped me really, as i could... technically open the devtools panel, see the requests that are
        being made, and get to my target, the .pck and .wasm files that contain all the code, assets and plugins for the
        project.
        <br>
        So i navigated to the Network section, found the files that are fetched from... another website..? whatever, i
        just downloaded them to my computer
        <br>
        I brute forced the .pck with the appropriately named, PCK Bruteforcer (took ages.) which gave me a key which i
        used in gdsdecomp to FINALLY unencrypt and extract the contents of the .pck which gave me a neatly organized
        folder with the assets.
        <br>
        I then navigated my way to .godot/imported, and wah lah!!!!!!! the assets!!!! they were all in godot's
        interpreted format tho, so i had to use gdsdecomp to finally extract them to something usable.
